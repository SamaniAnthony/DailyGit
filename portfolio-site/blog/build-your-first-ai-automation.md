# How to Build Your First AI Automation Using ChatGPT + Zapier

If you’ve ever copied data from one app to another, replied to the same question repeatedly, or manually posted updates across platforms — this guide is for you.

## Why This Matters

Most people think AI is about creating complex models. It’s not.  
Real business value comes from automating repetitive work so you can focus on higher-value tasks — and the easiest way to start is by connecting **ChatGPT** with **Zapier**.

By the end of this guide, you’ll have a working automation that uses ChatGPT to generate content (or responses) and Zapier to deliver it anywhere you want — hands-free.

## What You’ll Need

- **ChatGPT Plus** (for API access)  
- **Zapier account**  
- **A target app** (Google Docs, Gmail, Slack, Notion, etc.)

## Step 1: Define Your Use Case

Pick one repetitive workflow — for example:

- Generating social media captions from blog titles  
- Creating summaries of new emails  
- Drafting follow-up messages after a client books a call  

Start small: one trigger → one ChatGPT task → one output.

## Step 2: Set Up Your Trigger in Zapier

In Zapier, create a new Zap and choose a trigger app.  
Example: “New row in Google Sheets” or “New form submission in Typeform.”

This starts your automation whenever new data is added.

## Step 3: Add ChatGPT as an Action

Choose the **OpenAI** integration → **“Conversation” or “Generate Text”**.  
Prompt example:

> “Write a short LinkedIn post using this title: {{Sheet Title}}. Keep it friendly, informative, and under 80 words.”

Test it — you should see a natural, human-like output.

## Step 4: Send the Output Somewhere Useful

Add a final action to post or store your result. You can:  
- Send to **Slack** (for team review)  
- Post to **LinkedIn/Twitter** (auto-publishing)  
- Save to **Google Docs or Notion**

## Step 5: Scale or Combine

Once you’ve tested one use case, expand:  
- Add filters for smarter logic  
- Include multiple output channels  
- Feed your automations into Airtable or Notion for tracking

## Key Takeaway

This simple system is the foundation of every AI-powered business.  
You’ve connected reasoning (**ChatGPT**) with automation (**Zapier**) — and that combination scales infinitely.

What used to take 10 minutes now takes zero.  
That’s your first real AI automation.
