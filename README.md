## 📌 Purpose

This repository serves as a personal coding journal where I:

- Practice coding daily
- Build consistency through small, focused sessions
- Learn new concepts, patterns, and tools
- Refine my problem-solving and debugging skills
- Document my journey as a self-taught developer

## 🔁 Commitment

I make **at least one meaningful Git commit every day**.  
Even if it's just a few lines of code, a solved bug, or a learning note that made a meaningful impact in my learning journey. —**progress is progress**.

## 🛠️ What's Inside

- Practice problems and solutions
- Notes from daily study sessions
- Refactored snippets or mini-projects
- Debugging exercises and logic breakdowns
- Some partial and full projects I am or have worked on

> Think of this repo as a digital garden: some ideas are seeds, some are fully grown.

## 🚀 Why This Matters

After years of on-and-off learning, I’ve realized that consistent, deliberate practice is the key to breaking through. This repo is my way of staying accountable and continuing to grow—one commit at a time.
