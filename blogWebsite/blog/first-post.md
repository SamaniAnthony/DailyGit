# My First Blog Post

Welcome to my portfolio blog! This is an example blog post written in Markdown that gets automatically converted to HTML.

## Why Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that's easy to write and read. It's perfect for blog posts because:

- **Simple syntax** - Focus on writing, not formatting
- **Portable** - Works everywhere
- **Version control friendly** - Perfect for Git

## Getting Started

To add your own blog posts, simply:

1. Create a new `.md` file in the `blog/` directory
2. Add an entry to `blog/posts.json` with the post metadata
3. Write your content in Markdown format

### Code Examples

You can even include code snippets:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet('World');
```

## What's Next?

Replace this example post with your own content and start sharing your thoughts with the world!
